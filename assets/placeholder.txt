This directory should contain the following icon files:

1. icon.png - Main app icon (256x256 recommended)
2. icon.ico - Windows icon file for the executable
3. tray-icon.png - Small icon for system tray (16x16 or 32x32)

For now, the app will work without these icons, but you may see default Electron icons.

To add your own icons:
- Create PNG files with the names above
- Place them in this assets directory
- The app will automatically use them when available
